The fourth is the mirror grinding, polishing and testing building.","measurementHash":"2f2ed85fb5354b76fff9ab2584305fd6","length":525,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"4fe09a71-e747-409b-9774-9ce1a844eac9","item":"ff551dc2-7b1f-4eee-9ef8-985f53af1996","type":"text","html":"<p>Takahashi’s staff includes: optical, design and mechanical engineers many of whom are amateur astronomers, who have discovered new asteroids one of which was named Urii in honor of the city where the Takahashi manufacturing facilities are located.</p>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"source":"ff551dc2-7b1f-4eee-9ef8-985f53af1996","publisher":{},"starred":true},"src":null,"text":"Takahashi’s staff includes: optical, design and mechanical engineers many of whom are amateur astronomers, who have discovered new asteroids one of which was named Urii in honor of the city where the Takahashi manufacturing facilities are located.","measurementHash":"d266666a7487b8fa723c7943b352d885","length":247,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16}],"sites":["the-domains/takahashi"],"publisher":{},"starredBlocks":{"image":[{"block":{"id":"4d6fda5a-01eb-4d2c-95d0-eea79364ed7d","item":"ff551dc2-7b1f-4eee-9ef8-985f53af1996","type":"image","html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6346b855-ae4b-4cc7-a6a6-313370b95eed.jpg\">","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"description":"","@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6346b855-ae4b-4cc7-a6a6-313370b95eed.jpg","datePublished":null,"source":"ff551dc2-7b1f-4eee-9ef8-985f53af1996","publisher":{},"starred":true},"cover":{"original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6346b855-ae4b-4cc7-a6a6-313370b95eed.jpg","src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5673e4c74167e26856df8d79fbe5cd88/gradientmap.jpg?color1=%23030303&color2=%23020202&color3=%23A4A4A4&height=376&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6346b855-ae4b-4cc7-a6a6-313370b95eed.jpg&srgb=True&stop1=0.000001&stop2=0.3&stop3=0.9999999&width=581","animated":false,"exif":{"exif":{}},"factor":1,"rotation":0,"imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6346b855-ae4b-4cc7-a6a6-313370b95eed.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/053632b27ccb3f14eb630c95319a3c41.png","width":581,"height":376,"aspect":1.5452127659574468,"ratio":"581:376","orientation":"landscape","colors":[[255,255,255],[220,210,221],[161,165,148],[0,2,0],[113,114,108]],"faces":[],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[85,46],[499,354]],"confidence":0.252658,"center":[288,187],"radius":215.893}},"measurementHash":"053632b27ccb3f14eb630c95319a3c41","measure":["histogram","faces","saliency"],"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6346b855-ae4b-4cc7-a6a6-313370b95eed.jpg\">"}],"text":[{"block":{"id":"f48f6657-8796-4500-8316-976267828e3c","item":"ff551dc2-7b1f-4eee-9ef8-985f53af1996","type":"text","html":"<p>Takahashi began manufacturing telescopes in 1967 their 35th year of business.
