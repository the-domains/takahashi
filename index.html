Karla isn’t perfect — the spacing is set a little wide and some of the kerning looks a little off, however, this font has tons of character and there really aren’t any other quirky grotesques like this that are available for free. Karla is available in two weights — normal and bold — each with matching italics."},"screen":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.6363636363636364,"$type":["mono"],"$weight":2,"$width":2,"$contrast":2,"family":"Inconsolata","name":"Inconsolata","foundry":"google","license":"ofl","similar_to":["Akkurat Mono"],"description":"Inconsolata is an open-source monospaced typeface designed by Raph Levien. The design is humanist-inspired and takes cues from Avenir and Franklin Gothic according to the designer.
