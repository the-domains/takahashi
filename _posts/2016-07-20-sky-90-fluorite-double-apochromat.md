# SKY-90 Fluorite Double Apochromat

The SKY-90 is the ideal compromise between a wide-field astrograph and general-purpose observation refractor. Its great compactness makes it an excellent companion for the itinerant astrophotographer. Equipped with an apochromatic objective with Fluorite doublet of 90mm of aperture (F/5.6), it constitutes an unequalled optics for those wishing to have a transportable and general-purpose telescope, of a frightening effectiveness. Light, it does not require massive mounting.

A vast range of accessories makes it possible to cover the large uses of amateur astronomy, in particular two specific accessories, a focal reducer (F/4.5) and a 1.6x extender (see Accessories section).
