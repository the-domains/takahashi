# Epsilon-180ED Newtonian Astrograph

The Takahashi Epsilon-180ED (D=180mm, F/2.8), based on catadioptric telescope design (means association of lenses and mirrors) offers a fundamental innovation compared with Newton reflector or Schmidt astrograph. Therefore, the Epsilon-180ED suits both visual observation and large field imaging needs.

The Epsilon-180ED wide field is perfectly flat and allows the use of traditional photographic formats as 24x36 (35mm) or 6x6 and even 6x9\. Stellar images of less 20Âµ can be recorded, which highlights the extreme accuracy of this telescope. Epsilon's images provide incomparable contrast and sharpness.
