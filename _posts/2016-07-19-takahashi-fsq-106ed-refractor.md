  Based on a Petzval quadruplet optical design with apochromatic ED glasses, the
  FSQ-106ED is optimized for wide-field imaging of the deep sky. It offers a
  flat field, and comes equiped with a built-in camera angle adjuster and an
  oversized rack-and-pinion focuser. To minimize the size of the optical tube,
  it includes a retractable dewshield and an important backfocus.
