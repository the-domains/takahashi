  The TOA-150 is available either the tube itself (OTA) or complete
  configuration. In spite of its size and its weight, this refractor can be used
  as an itinerant mode, particularly when it is associated with the EM-400
  equatorial mount. This will allow the end-user to take advantage of the best
  night skies.
