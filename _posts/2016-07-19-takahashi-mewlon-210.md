# Takahashi Mewlon 210

You have dreamed of a reflector with exceptional and powerful optics, with a generous diameter and with the guarantee of an incredible contrast : Mewlon is for you !

With its Cassegrain range reflectors, based on Dall-Kirkham optical design, Takahashi acted as a pioneer, and made Schmidt-Cassegrain other manufacturers outdated. This reflector with its excellent optical qualities can be used in a wide range of applications, and brings it on the top of the market. No worldwide mass production of reflectors can be compared to the Mewlon and be able to offer similar performances : compactness, power, rationality and versatility.

Mewlon are available in 3 diameters (210mm, 250mm and 300mm), optical tube assemblies (OTAs) or associated with equatorial mountings.
