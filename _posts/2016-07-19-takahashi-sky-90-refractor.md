  The SKY-90 is the ideal compromise between a wide-field astrograph and
  general-purpose observation refractor. Its great compactness makes it an
  excellent companion for the itinerant astrophotographer. Equipped with an
  apochromatic objective with Fluorite doublet of 90mm of aperture (F/5.6), it
  constitutes an unequalled optics for those wishing to have a transportable and
  general-purpose telescope, of a frightening effectiveness.
