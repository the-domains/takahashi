# The Takahashi FS-60CB

apochromatic refractor is the itinerant telescope par excellence. It features exceptional optical and mechanichal qualities (objective with Fluorite doublet) and an incredible compact design. All Takahashi is in it.

Its great versatility will charm all the observers. It can easily be used for the visual observation, as well as astronomical or terrestrial. For the photographers, it is transformed into wide field astrograph or guiding scope. For this last function, Takahashi proposes even an optional specific parallel support, the TGM.
