  The Takahashi FS-60CB apochromatic refractor is the itinerant telescope par
  excellence. It features exceptional optical and mechanichal qualities
  (objective with Fluorite doublet) and an incredible compact design. All
  Takahashi is in it.


  Its great versatility will charm all the observers. It can easily be used for
  the visual observation, as well as astronomical or terrestrial. For the
  photographers, it is transformed into wide field astrograph or guiding scope.
  For this last function, Takahashi proposes even an optional specific parallel
  support, the TGM.
